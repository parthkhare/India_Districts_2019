# Standardizing Indian District Names

Updated spatial polygons for India are hard to come by and even if one is lucky, there are issues with merging them with administrative data due to varying nomenclature and classic devnagri to english translation. Moreover, Fuzzy merges & NLP are seldom helpful in this regard. The following repo standardizes Indian district under three classification: <br /> 
1. Duplicate district names <br /> 
2. District with multiple names (or renamed sigh:( ) <br /> 
3. Leftover string steralizations <br />  <br /> 

With multiple agencies using varying nomenclature, the standardised names have been decided based on the Indian Census or Google Earth (to help geocoding). The incorrect names have compiled from atleast 20+ different versions of Indian shapefiles where the most frequent incorrect name is chosen

With Covid, India we finally know that there are 739 districts in India in 2020. Here I have compiled district names based on two version of shapefiles, with 693 and 735 districts respectively. 

This has been a intensively manual exercise and is intended is to help non-Indian/Hindi speakers to save unecessary time. Do share if you know of names and feel free to share. Will be updated recent versions of shapefiles here.
